# CLOUD-STORAGE-CREATION-S3-AND-LAUNCHING-AN-EC2-INSTANCE-IN-AWS-
 
## Aim: 
 To launch an EC2 instance in AWS cloud. 
 Procedure: 
Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
Go to   https://console.aws.amazon.com

Sign in with your credentials.


 Step 2: Open the EC2 Dashboard
In the AWS Console, search for EC2 in the services search bar.
Click on EC2 to open the EC2 Dashboard.


 Step 3: Launch a New Instance
Click “Launch Instance”.

 Step 4: Configure Basic Details
Name your instance (optional but helpful).
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows).
Choose an Instance Type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).


 Step 5: Configure Key Pair (Login)
Under Key pair, select an existing key pair or create a new one.
Download and store the .pem file safely.
You’ll use this to SSH into the instance later.


 Step 6: Configure Network Settings
Choose a VPC and subnet (default is usually fine).
Select or create a security group:
Allow SSH (port 22) for Linux or RDP (port 3389) for Windows.

Optionally open HTTP/HTTPS if you’re running a web server.


 Step 7: Configure Storage
Set the storage volume size (default is typically 8GB).
You can adjust it depending on your needs.


 Step 8: Review and Launch
Review your settings.
Click Launch Instance.


 Step 9: Connect to Your Instance
Once the instance state is running, select the instance.
Click Connect, and follow the instructions:
For Linux: Use SSH and your .pem file.
For Windows: Use RDP and the password generated with your key.
